Our new website is finally up and running! Welcome to our new home created using **Hugo** and **PaperMod**. We are currently using GitHub for hosting as their build and deploy pipelines are so easy to work with.

I spent around 5 hours trying to coax a WordPress theme into doing what I want and failing miserably. Creating the site this way gave us full control to format things however we wanted. Having said that, the PaperMod theme does a really good job and required only minimal tweaking.

We are hoping to upload some new images and have a lyrics and tab section also.
