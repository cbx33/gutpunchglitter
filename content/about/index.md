Early start
-----------
Our story started around sometime in **1998** when two friends, Ben and Pete started a band. Ben had been wanting to start one for a while, bought a guitar and was looking for some instruction. Pete had been studying Piano for a number of years and Ben asked him to teach him guitar. Having never played guitar before, Pete bought a cheap nylon strung acoustic guitar, learnt a few chords and taught Ben. The two of them spent the summer playing togther, learning to play their favourite songs and working on a few themselves. Ben very quickly surpassed Pete, and was soon soloing happily.

After recruiting another friend to play bass, the band realised they needed a drummer. Pete offered to learn and the group purchased a drum kit from the local classifieds. **Nokatomi Bleach** was born. A vocalist joined the quartet and the group recorded multiple tracks in Ben's garage.

Breakup + Hiatus
----------------
After a while the musical differences began to show in the group. Pete was more interested in punk, and Ben leaned towards heavier rock. The differences led to the bands break up in 2000 and the members all went their separate ways.

New Beginnings
--------------
Following a chance encounter around fifteen years later between Ben and Pete, the two exchanged a few test messages. When COVID hit, Ben reached out to Pete and suggested he had a desire to make music again. He showed Pete a few tracks he was working on and asked if he'd be able to supply any piano/synth to back some of it up.

Pete recorded a few bits and when Ben asked if Pete had any tracks lying around unused, Pete obliged and added a few more to the mix. For the next year the two communicated almost exclusively over the Signal instance messaging system, transferring ideas in voice messages and sending back and forth bits of MIDI and score.

In September 2022, the duo released their first single from their new venture under the name **Gut Punch Glitter**. While they released the 8 tracks from the album, they were already hard at work producing a second, with 7 new tracks already made up in demo form.
